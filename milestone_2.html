  <h1>Storyboarding</h1>
  <p>We wrote storyboards for our three ideas in Milestone 1 in order to flesh them out a bit more. </p>
  <p>
    <h4>Musician Critique</h4>
    <img src="imgs/milestone-2/data2.jpg" class="img-responsive">
    <div>We received feedback on our original idea that this was not everyday and directly communicating with each other. We talked to the teaching staff/brainstormed ways to make this a more communicative idea that fit the prompt, and came up with the idea of a live practice session for remote audiences. Music practice is something that must be done regularly to maintain one's skill, so this is an everyday context. The idea here was that musicians perform differently in front of an audience, and that this remote practice system will allow musicians to develop their skills in ways that individual practice cannot.</div>
  </p>

  <p>
    <h4>Addict Support Network</h4>
    <img src="imgs/milestone-2/data1.jpg" class="img-responsive">
    <div>We further refiend our original idea to figure out how those in a support network can communicate with each other. We came up with the idea for a platform that individuals can go to when they get a craving. This strong community can communicate with each other through live video messages to get them through 'that moment'. We did note, however, that this would be a sensitive topic to approach. </div>
  </p>

  <p>
    <h4>"Living Room" for cultural/generational translation</h4>
      <img src="imgs/milestone-2/data3.jpg" class="img-responsive">
      <div>We struggled with figuring out a good implementation for this idea, and this storyboard illustrates our best idea. In this case, we have a common "living room" video portal where family members can communicate with each other, with a easy way to supplement each others' conversations. </div>
